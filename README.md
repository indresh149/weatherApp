# How to run project locally
1. Clone the github repo
2. Make a .env file
3. Add api key for GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY and WEATHER_API. (you can contact me on whats app : 9315592742 if you don't know how to generate both API keys)
4. Run Yarn add
5. Run yarn start to start the metro to build the debug app.

# Problems faced
1 The first problem I faced was using Google Maps API to get the address name of a place from longitude and latitude as the API key is not working initially.
2.The second problem I faced was calling many API calls at the search and the start of the app.
